        The mission of The TMJ School,
          where the students come first,
          is to partner with parents to develop 
          enthusiastic learners within a nurturing
          and stimulating environment.<br>
          An institution where each student feels engaged and secure, 
          and where they learn to be citizens of a culturally diverse society. 
          We believe that children, who will be our future,
          must be followers before becoming leaders, 
          followers of values, followers of ethics and
          followers of morals that holds us together as residents 
          of a trend changing global society.
          Our school ethos is based on the philosophy that imparting modern education 
          while keeping us grounded to our roots helps in preparing students to face the fast developing world.
          We envision to not only support and widen their horizon but also provide 
          them with state-of-art infrastructure to develop more comprehensively 
          and think innovatively while being aware of our ever growing environmental responsibilities.
          We at The TMJ School believe that each child is unique with his/her own ability. 
          Our aim is to harness that ability and develop it to the best of our capability 
          and to inculcate in them a sense of pride, tolerance and confidence as they
          take their first steps into the world of their own.</h2></div>
